## Zooming and rotating

+ Open blender

When you open Blender, Blender starts with a Splash screen. The Splash screen of Blender 2.76 looks like the figure below.

For this tutorial we won't be needing the Splash screen.

+ Click to the right of the Splash screen to make it disappear.

In the centre you'll see the 3D view. In this space you'll be positioning all the items that need to be displayed or rendered. You have 3 different items in the 3D view. We will be looking at those later.

In the 3D view you can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.

+ Try to zoom in and out of the cube.

In the 3D view you can rotate the whole scene by pressing the middle mouse button or the mouse wheel in and rotating around.

+ Try rotating your scene.
