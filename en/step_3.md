## The 3D scene

The 3D view looks a bit like the environment in a 3D computer game. There are three main components in the 3D scene that you need to understand to get started.

The cube in the centre is the **shape** which will be rendered and shown in the image.

The scene has a **light source** which shows where light is shining from. 

![The light source is represented by a central dot and rings of dashes surrounding it. ](images/light-source.png)

--- task ---

Rotate the scene until you see the top of the light source.

The scene has a **camera** which points at the scene.

![The camera is represented by a pyramid drawn with lines for edges.](images/camera.png)

--- task ---

Select `View` > `Cameras` > `Active Camera` to see what the camera sees.

![Using the menu in Blender to select View > Cameras > Active Camera](images/camera-view.png)

You will see a nice picture of the side of the cube.
