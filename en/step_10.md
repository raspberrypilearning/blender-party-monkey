## What can you do now?

If you are following the [Blender](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/blender-basics) pathway, you can move on to the [Snowman](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blender-tree-of-cubes) project. In this project, you will learn how to resize objects by creating a simple tree of cubes.
