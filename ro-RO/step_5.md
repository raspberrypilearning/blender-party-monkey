## Selecting and moving

To select an object in Blender, use the left mouse button.

+ Select the cube with the left mouse button. You'll see an orange border around the cube.

In Blender you can move objects by using the blue, green, and red handles: The blue handle to go up and down on the z-axis, the green handle to go left and right on the y-axis, and the red handle to go in and out on the x-axis. From Blender 2.8, you will need to click on the move gizmo from the list of icons on the left of your screen to make the handles appear.

+ Move the cube up by pressing the blue handle with the left mouse button and moving it up. When you press the blue handle, you'll see a blue line appear. Move the cube along the blue line.

+ Move the cube to the right by pressing the green handle with the left mouse button and moving it to the right. When you press the green handle, you'll see a green line appear. Move the cube along the green line.

+ Move the cube in or out by pressing the red handle with the left mouse button and moving it back and forth. When you press the red handle, you'll see a red line appear. Move the cube along the red line.

+ Move the cube around your scene to a different position.

+ Go to the render view to see what it will look like. For example:

You might see nothing or only part of the cube. This means that the object is not (completely) in the camera's view.

+ Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to get out of the render view.

+ Move the 3D scene with the middle mouse button to behind the camera. For example:

![Move behind camera](images/move-behind-camera.png)

+ Move the cube using the blue, green, and red handles such that you can see the cube from behind the camera.

+ Render again to see how your image looks. You probably will see the same image as before.

+ Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit the render view.
