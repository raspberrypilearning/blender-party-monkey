## Zooming and rotating

+ Open Blender.

When you open Blender, it starts with a splash screen. The splash screen of Blender v2.76 looks like this:

For this tutorial we won't be needing the splash screen.

+ Click to the right of the splash screen to make it disappear.

In the centre, you'll see the 3D view. In this space you'll be positioning all the items that need to be displayed or rendered. You have three different items in the 3D view already. We will be looking at those later.

In the 3D view, you can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel.

+ Try to zoom in and out of the cube.

You can rotate the whole scene by pressing the middle mouse button or the mouse wheel and rotating around.

+ Try rotating your scene.
